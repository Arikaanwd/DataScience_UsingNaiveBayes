# **Machine Learning of Iris Data Using Naive Bayes**

Datasets that have been provided in Scikit-learn. Can be accessed at the link :

**About Data Iris**

The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A. Fisher. The dataset is taken from Fisher’s paper. Note that it’s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points. This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher’s paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
Data Set Characteristics:
- Number of Instances : 150 (50 in each of three classes)
- Number of Attributes : 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class
- Attribute Information : sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, petal width in cm
- class :
    Iris-Setosa
    Iris-Versicolour
    Iris-Virginica

**Goals**

Obtained knowledge about iris data and the distribution of classes that have contributed to the data, and results that provide knowledge in classifying iris data with class species consisting of (0,1,2). 

**Insight**

- The histoplot shows the distribution of shank length by species which shows that species 0 is higher than the other species.
- The boxplot shows the distribution with outliers between sepai length and species resulting in species 1 having no outliers.
- The histoplot with standard deviation shows results with better variation in the species 0 class.
- The correlation matrix shows the relationship between columns in the data.
