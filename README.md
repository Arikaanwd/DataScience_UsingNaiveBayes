**About Data Iris**

The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A. Fisher. The dataset is taken from Fisher’s paper. Note that it’s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points. This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher’s paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
Data Set Characteristics:
- Number of Instances : 150 (50 in each of three classes)
- Number of Attributes : 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class
- Attribute Information : sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, petal width in cm
- class :
    Iris-Setosa
    Iris-Versicolour
    Iris-Virginica
